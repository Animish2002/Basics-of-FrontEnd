👉 “The callback queue (or macro-task queue) holds asynchronous callbacks like setTimeout and I/O operations. 
The event loop only moves them to the call stack once the stack is empty and all microtasks (like promises) are processed.”

What is the Callback Queue?

The callback queue is where asynchronous callback functions (macro-tasks) wait before being executed by the event loop.
These callbacks are moved to the queue after Web APIs / Node APIs finish their work.
The event loop then pushes them into the call stack when it is empty and after microtasks are cleared.

🔹 Examples of tasks that go into the Callback Queue:

setTimeout
setInterval
setImmediate (Node.js)
I/O callbacks (file system, network requests in Node.js)
UI rendering events (in browser)
