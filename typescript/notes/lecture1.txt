javascript is loosely type language

a variable declared does not have a type to it it can be changes to anyother type and js will be fine with it but this is not a 
good thing 

enters typescript which lets us define type to various type 

when define a variable in ts do by const x:number = 1 or const x:string = "string"

the final file what we alway run is the javascript file not the ts file 
ts is just a syntactical language that gets compiled down to javascript 

to convert ts code to js  use command => tsc -b

different types in ts 
number, string, boolean, null, undefined

function sum(a: number, b: number):number here we define the output must also return number
